# Network-Analysis-with-NetworkX-Exploring-Degree-Clustering-Coefficient-and-Centrality-Measures

This project focuses on network analysis using the NetworkX library. It covers various aspects of network analysis, including degree, clustering coefficient, and centrality measures. The project consists of the following tasks:

## Degree, Clustering Coefficient, and Components: 

<ul>
<li>Design a small network with 6 nodes and compute the clustering coefficient for each node, comparing the results with NetworkX.</li>
<li>Analyze an undirected network with nodes of degree k = 1, determining the conditions for the network size N, degree distribution, and number of components.</li>
<li>Explore a network with nodes of degree k = 2 and clustering coefficient C = 1, understanding the network structure and conditions satisfied by N.</li>

## Network Analysis of the Zachary Karate Club:
<ul>
<li>Use the NetworkX function to create and load the Zachary karate club network, a well-known social network.</li>
<li>Compute key characteristics of the network and visualize it, adjusting node sizes based on their degrees.</li>
<li>Calculate the edge density of the Karate club network, comparing your own algorithm with the NetworkX function.</li>
<li>Plot graphs of degree centrality, closeness centrality, eigenvector centrality, betweenness centrality, and subgraph centrality against the nodes, providing insightful comments.</li>
<li>Calculate the average clustering coefficient using both your own algorithm and the NetworkX function, interpreting the results.</li>
<li>Compute the degree distribution P(k) and complementary cumulative degree distribution 1 - CDF(k) of the network, visualizing them using matplotlib.pyplot.</li>
<li>Calculate the average shortest path length of the network using NetworkX.</li>
<li>Create a scatter plot of Ci (clustering coefficient of node i) as a function of ki (degree of node i), offering an interpretation of the relationship.</li>
</ul>

By completing these tasks, you will gain hands-on experience with NetworkX, understand fundamental network properties, analyze social networks, interpret centrality measures, and visualize network characteristics. The project provides a comprehensive exploration of network analysis using NetworkX and can be a valuable resource for anyone interested in network analysis and visualization.
